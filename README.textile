h1. Ribbit

_noun: a frog that likes to HTTParty with the Bit.ly URL shortening service_

h2. Existential Rationale

I created Ribbit because I needed a Bit.ly client that can do more than just shorten URL's. RibBit takes advantage of "Bitly's":http://bit.ly statistics features so I can track the links I create.

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
